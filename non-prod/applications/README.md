# Application blue prints

## Idea
This folder only contains blue prints of generic artifacts (e.g. the edgemicro gateway).
The artifacts themselves are getting patched by files with the op: replace operator, located in the namespaces folder.

## Scope
Artifact definitions and use case sepecific parameters should be decoupled to enable automated updates of artifacts.
